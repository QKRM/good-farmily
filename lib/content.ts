Leghorns can lay up to 300 white eggs per year, while Rhode Island Reds produce around 250-300 brown eggs annually. Sussex chickens are dual-purpose birds that lay approximately 250 eggs per year while also being suitable for meat production.",

      "Secure your coop with predator-proof fencing buried at least 12 inches deep to prevent digging. Use hardware cloth (not chicken wire) with Â¼-inch or smaller openings. Install automatic coop doors that close at dusk, use motion-activated lights, and consider livestock guardian animals. Regularly inspect for and repair any potential entry points in the coop structure.",

Rotational grazing can improve land efficiency by 25-30%. For feedlot operations, allow 125-150 square feet per animal for proper spacing, while dairy operations need approximately 80-100 square feet of loafing area per cow.",

Saanens produce the highest volume at 1-3 gallons per day with lower butterfat (2.5-3%). Nubians give 1-2 gallons with high butterfat content (4-5%), making their milk excellent for cheese and soap making. LaMancha and Toggenburg are also reliable dairy breeds.",
